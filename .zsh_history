     ssh -- OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)\

         [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile]\

\
DESCRIPTION\
     ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for exe-\
     cuting commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to replace rlogin and\
     rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts\
     over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and\
     UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.\
\
     ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user name).\
     The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using one of sev-\
     eral methods depending on the protocol version used (see below).\
\
     If command is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a\
     login shell.\
\
     The options are as follows:\
\
     -1      Forces ssh to try protocol version 1 only.\
\
     -2      Forces ssh to try protocol version 2 only.\
\
     -4      Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.\
\
     -6      Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.\
\
     -A      Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This can\
             also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.\
\
             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the\
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the\
             agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent through the\
             forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from\
             the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys that\
             enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into the\
             agent.\
\
     -a      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.\
\
     -b bind_address\
             Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of the\
             connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one address.\
\
     -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr,\
             and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections).  The\
             compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the ``level''\
             can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for protocol ver-\
             sion 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and other slow con-\
             nections, but will only slow down things on fast networks.  The\
             default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the configura-\
             tion files; see the Compression option.\
\
     -c cipher_spec\
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.\
\
             Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.  The\
             supported values are ``3des'', ``blowfish'', and ``des''.  For pro-\
             tocol version 2, cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of ciphers\
             listed in order of preference.  See the Ciphers keyword in\
             ssh_config(5) for more information.\
\
     -D [bind_address:]port\
             Specifies a local ``dynamic'' application-level port forwarding.\
             This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local\
             side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a\
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over\
             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to\
             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently\
             the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act as a\
             SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.  Dynamic port\
             forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.\
\
             IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square\
             brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  By\
             default, the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts\
             setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the\
             connection to a specific address.  The bind_address of ``localhost''\
             indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while\
             an empty address or `*' indicates that the port should be available\
             from all interfaces.\
\
     -E log_file\
             Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.\
\
     -e escape_char\
             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: `~').\
             The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line.\
             The escape character followed by a dot (`.') closes the connection;\
             followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and followed by\
             itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the character to\
             ``none'' disables any escapes and makes the session fully transpar-\
             ent.\
\
     -F configfile\
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a configu-\
             ration file is given on the command line, the system-wide configura-\
             tion file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignored.  The default for\
             the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.\
\
     -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.\
             This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or passphrases,\
             but the user wants it in the background.  This implies -n.  The rec-\
             ommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with some-\
             thing like ssh -f host xterm.\
\
             If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to ``yes'',\
             then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port forwards\
             to be successfully established before placing itself in the back-\
             ground.\
\
     -G      Causes ssh to print its configuration after evaluating Host and\
             Match blocks and exit.\

CHMOD(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 CHMOD(1)\
\
NAME\
     chmod -- change file modes or Access Control Lists\
\
SYNOPSIS\
     chmod [-fv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] mode file ...\
     chmod [-fv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-a | +a | =a] ACE file ...\
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-E] file ...\
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-C] file ...\
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-N] file ...\
\
DESCRIPTION\
     The chmod utility modifies the file mode bits of the listed files as speci-\
     fied by the mode operand. It may also be used to modify the Access Control\
     Lists (ACLs) associated with the listed files.\
\
     The generic options are as follows:\
\
     -f      Do not display a diagnostic message if chmod could not modify the\
             mode for file.\
\
     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line\
             are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are\
             not followed by default.)\
\
     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the mode of the link itself\
             rather than the file that the link points to.\
\
     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.\
\
     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.  This\
             is the default.\
\
     -R      Change the modes of the file hierarchies rooted in the files instead\
             of just the files themselves.\
\
     -v      Cause chmod to be verbose, showing filenames as the mode is modi-\
             fied.  If the -v flag is specified more than once, the old and new\
             modes of the file will also be printed, in both octal and symbolic\
             notation.\
\
     The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.  In\
     addition, these options override each other and the command's actions are\
     determined by the last one specified.\
\
     Only the owner of a file or the super-user is permitted to change the mode\
     of a file.\
\
DIAGNOSTICS\
     The chmod utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\
\
MODES\
     Modes may be absolute or symbolic.  An absolute mode is an octal number con-\
     structed from the sum of one or more of the following values:\
\
           4000    (the set-user-ID-on-execution bit) Executable files with this\
                   bit set will run with effective uid set to the uid of the file\
                   owner.  Directories with the set-user-id bit set will force\
                   all files and sub-directories created in them to be owned by\
                   the directory owner and not by the uid of the creating\
                   process, if the underlying file system supports this feature:\
                   see chmod(2) and the suiddir option to mount(8).\
           2000    (the set-group-ID-on-execution bit) Executable files with this\
                   bit set will run with effective gid set to the gid of the file\
                   owner.\
           1000    (the sticky bit) See chmod(2) and sticky(8).\
           0400    Allow read by owner.\
           0200    Allow write by owner.\
           0100    For files, allow execution by owner.  For directories, allow\
                   the owner to search in the directory.\
           0040    Allow read by group members.\
           0020    Allow write by group members.\
           0010    For files, allow execution by group members.  For directories,\
                   allow group members to search in the directory.\
           0004    Allow read by others.\
           0002    Allow write by others.\
           0001    For files, allow execution by others.  For directories allow\
                   others to search in the directory.\
\
     For example, the absolute mode that permits read, write and execute by the\
     owner, read and execute by group members, read and execute by others, and no\
     set-uid or set-gid behaviour is 755 (400+200+100+040+010+004+001).\
\
     The symbolic mode is described by the following grammar:\
\
           mode         ::= clause [, clause ...]\
           clause       ::= [who ...] [action ...] action\
           action       ::= op [perm ...]\
           who          ::= a | u | g | o\
           op           ::= + | - | =\
           perm         ::= r | s | t | w | x | X | u | g | o\
\
     The who symbols ``u'', ``g'', and ``o'' specify the user, group, and other\
     parts of the mode bits, respectively.  The who symbol ``a'' is equivalent to\
     ``ugo''.\
\
     The perm symbols represent the portions of the mode bits as follows:\
\
           r       The read bits.\
           s       The set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution\
                   bits.\
           t       The sticky bit.\
           w       The write bits.\
           x       The execute/search bits.\
           X       The execute/search bits if the file is a directory or any of\
                   the execute/search bits are set in the original (unmodified)\
                   mode.  Operations with the perm symbol ``X'' are only meaning-\
                   ful in conjunction with the op symbol ``+'', and are ignored\
                   in all other cases.\
           u       The user permission bits in the original mode of the file.\
           g       The group permission bits in the original mode of the file.\
           o       The other permission bits in the original mode of the file.\
\
     The op symbols represent the operation performed, as follows:\
\
     +     If no value is supplied for perm, the ``+'' operation has no effect.\
           If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit specified in\
           perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode creation mask\
           is clear, is set.  Otherwise, the mode bits represented by the speci-\
           fied who and perm values are set.\
\
     -     If no value is supplied for perm, the ``-'' operation has no effect.\
           If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit specified in\
           perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode creation mask\
           is clear, is cleared.  Otherwise, the mode bits represented by the\
           specified who and perm values are cleared.\
\
     =     The mode bits specified by the who value are cleared, or, if no who\
           value is specified, the owner, group and other mode bits are cleared.\
           Then, if no value is supplied for who, each permission bit specified\
           in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode creation\
           mask is clear, is set.  Otherwise, the mode bits represented by the\
           specified who and perm values are set.\
\
     Each clause specifies one or more operations to be performed on the mode\
     bits, and each operation is applied to the mode bits in the order specified.\
\
     Operations upon the other permissions only (specified by the symbol ``o'' by\
     itself), in combination with the perm symbols ``s'' or ``t'', are ignored.\
\
EXAMPLES OF VALID MODES\
     644           make a file readable by anyone and writable by the owner only.\
\
     go-w          deny write permission to group and others.\
\
     =rw,+X        set the read and write permissions to the usual defaults, but\
                   retain any execute permissions that are currently set.\
\
     +X            make a directory or file searchable/executable by everyone if\
                   it is already searchable/executable by anyone.\
\
     755\
     u=rwx,go=rx\
     u=rwx,go=u-w  make a file readable/executable by everyone and writable by\
                   the owner only.\
\
     go=           clear all mode bits for group and others.\
\
     g=u-w         set the group bits equal to the user bits, but clear the group\
                   write bit.\
\
ACL MANIPULATION OPTIONS\
     ACLs are manipulated using extensions to the symbolic mode grammar.  Each\
     file has one ACL, containing an ordered list of entries.  Each entry refers\
     to a user or group, and grants or denies a set of permissions.  In cases\
     where a user and a group exist with the same name, the user/group name can\
     be prefixed with "user:" or "group:" in order to specify the type of name.\
\
     If the user or group name contains spaces you can use ':' as the delimiter\
     between name and permission.\
\
     The following permissions are applicable to all filesystem objects:\
           delete  Delete the item.  Deletion may be granted by either this per-\
                   mission on an object or the delete_child right on the contain-\
                   ing directory.\
           readattr\
                   Read an objects basic attributes.  This is implicitly granted\
                   if the object can be looked up and not explicitly denied.\
           writeattr\
                   Write an object's basic attributes.\
           readextattr\
                   Read extended attributes.\
           writeextattr\
                   Write extended attributes.\
           readsecurity\
                   Read an object's extended security information (ACL).\
           writesecurity\
                   Write an object's security information (ownership, mode, ACL).\
           chown   Change an object's ownership.\
\
     The following permissions are applicable to directories:\
           list    List entries.\
           search  Look up files by name.\
           add_file\
                   Add a file.\
           add_subdirectory\
                   Add a subdirectory.\
           delete_child\
                   Delete a contained object.  See the file delete permission\
                   above.\
\
     The following permissions are applicable to non-directory filesystem\
     objects:\
           read    Open for reading.\
           write   Open for writing.\
           append  Open for writing, but in a fashion that only allows writes\
                   into areas of the file not previously written.\
           execute\
                   Execute the file as a script or program.\
\
     ACL inheritance is controlled with the following permissions words, which\
     may only be applied to directories:\
           file_inherit\
                   Inherit to files.\
           directory_inherit\
                   Inherit to directories.\
           limit_inherit\
                   This flag is only relevant to entries inherited by subdirecto-\
                   ries; it causes the directory_inherit flag to be cleared in\
                   the entry that is inherited, preventing further nested subdi-\
                   rectories from also inheriting the entry.\
           only_inherit\
                   The entry is inherited by created items but not considered\
                   when processing the ACL.\
\
     The ACL manipulation options are as follows:\
\
     +a      The +a mode parses a new ACL entry from the next argument on the\
             commandline and inserts it into the canonical location in the ACL.\
             If the supplied entry refers to an identity already listed, the two\
             entries are combined.\
\
             Examples\
              # ls -le\
              -rw-r--r--+ 1 juser  wheel  0 Apr 28 14:06 file1\
              # chmod +a "admin allow write" file1\
              # ls -le\
              -rw-r--r--+ 1 juser  wheel  0 Apr 28 14:06 file1\
                owner: juser\
                1: admin allow write\
              # chmod +a "guest deny read" file1\
              # ls -le\
              -rw-r--r--+ 1 juser  wheel  0 Apr 28 14:06 file1\
                owner: juser\
                1: guest deny read\
                2: admin allow write\
              # chmod +a "admin allow delete" file1\
              # ls -le\
              -rw-r--r--+ 1 juser  wheel  0 Apr 28 14:06 file1\
                owner: juser\
                1: guest deny read\
                2: admin allow write,delete\
              # chmod +a "User 1:allow:read" file\
              # ls -le\
              -rw-r--r--+ 1 juser  wheel  0 Apr 28 14:06 file1\
                owner: juser\
                1: guest deny read\
                2: User 1 allow read\
                3: admin allow write,delete\
\
             The +a mode strives to maintain correct canonical form for the ACL.\
                              local deny\
                              local allow\
                              inherited deny\
                              inherited allow\
\
             By default, chmod adds entries to the top of the local deny and\
             local allow lists. Inherited entries are added by using the +ai\
             mode.\
\
             Examples\
              # ls -le\
              -rw-r--r--+ 1 juser  wheel  0 Apr 28 14:06 file1\

CHMOD(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 CHMOD(1)\
\
NAME\
     chmod -- change file modes or Access Control Lists\
\
SYNOPSIS\
     chmod [-fv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] mode file ...\
     chmod [-fv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-a | +a | =a] ACE file ...\
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-E] file ...\
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-C] file ...\
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-N] file ...\
\
DESCRIPTION\
     The chmod utility modifies the file mode bits of the listed files as speci-\
     fied by the mode operand. It may also be used to modify the Access Control\
     Lists (ACLs) associated with the listed files.\
\
     The generic options are as follows:\
\
     -f      Do not display a diagnostic message if chmod could not modify the\
             mode for file.\
\
     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line\
             are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are\
             not followed by default.)\
\
     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the mode of the link itself\
             rather than the file that the link points to.\
\
     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.\
\
     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.  This\
             is the default.\
\
     -R      Change the modes of the file hierarchies rooted in the files instead\
             of just the files themselves.\
\
     -v      Cause chmod to be verbose, showing filenames as the mode is modi-\
             fied.  If the -v flag is specified more than once, the old and new\
             modes of the file will also be printed, in both octal and symbolic\
             notation.\
\
     The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.  In\
     addition, these options override each other and the command's actions are\
     determined by the last one specified.\
\
     Only the owner of a file or the super-user is permitted to change the mode\
     of a file.\
\
DIAGNOSTICS\
     The chmod utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\
\
MODES\
     Modes may be absolute or symbolic.  An absolute mode is an octal number con-\

Scientists working with America's space agency delivered their stunning news.\

(Thomas Zurbuchen / Associate Administrator, NASA)\
"There are actually seven Earth-size planets orbiting the nearby TRAPPIST-1 star, about 40 light-years away. The discovery gives us a hint that finding a second Earth is not just a matter of if, but when."\
\
The researchers are from various countries and published details of their discovery Thursday in the science journal Nature. They say judging by their distance from the dwarf star, as well as their mass, the planets could have water, not ice, on their surface. They also say six of them may have solid ground made from rock and other materials.\
Planets similar to Earth have been found in the past. But the scientists say this is the first time this many were found revolving around one star and relatively close to Earth..thumbnails/
